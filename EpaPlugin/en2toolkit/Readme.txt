=======================

EPANET is a program that analyzes the hydraulic and water quality behavior of water
distribution systems. The EPANET Programmer's Toolkit is a dynamic link library (DLL) of
functions that allows developers to customize EPANET's computational engine for their 
own specific needs. The functions can be incorporated into 32-bit Windows applications 
written in C/C++, Delphi Pascal, Visual Basic, or any other language that can call
functions within a Windows DLL. The Toolkit DLL file is named EPANET2.DLL and is
distributed with EPANET. The Toolkit comes with several different header files, function 
definition files, and .lib files that simplify the task of interfacing it with C/C++, 
Delphi, and Visual Basic code.
